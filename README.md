# Lucky-Numbers-Generator
A program that generates 8 lucky numbers sequences that the user wants (max 10)

In each sequences ;
- The first six numbers should be ordered from smallest to largest.
- The 7th number, which is the wildcard number, must be different from the first six numbers.
- The 8th number is the superstar number. It can be any number from 1 to 90. 
- Also I prepared the background images for the tickets myself
